Fibonacci Calculator
This program uses a custom structure and function to calculate the fibonacci sequence based on the arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) and conditions1.

Development Environment
The program is written in C language and can be compiled and run on any platform that supports C compiler. For example, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows.

How to Compile and Run
To compile the program, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system. You can use the following command to compile the program:

gcc -o fib fib.c
Copy
This will create an executable file named fibo in the same directory as the source code file fibo.c.

To run the program, you can use the following command:

./FIB
Copy
This will execute the program and print the results to the standard output.

Sample Output
The program will print the results of four calculations based on the given structure and function. The output should look like this:

add: 89
mul: 40
sub: -49
fibo: -1
Copy
Note that the fibonacci function returns -1 for negative inputs. You can modify this behavior as you wish.
